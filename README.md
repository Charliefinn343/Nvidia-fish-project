# Save the Fish AI

 Add short description of project here > 
 For my project, I decided to make sure that nobody catches or keeps illegal size fish by helping them identify what type of fish they caught.

## The Algorithm

If you look at the my-recognition.py file you will see the code for the AI. Lines 2-7 import the dependencies. Lines 8-18 are the code for identifying the fish species. Finally, lines 19-101 are responsible for saying four random facts about the fish after it has been identified. 
## Running this project
